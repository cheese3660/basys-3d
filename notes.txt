3D Rendering state machine overview

<Begin frame render>
1. Begin buffer clear

2. Update transformation constants based on button presses since last frame render

3. Wait for the buffer clear to end.

4. Load the rendering pipeline with all the triangles

    (This will have a few substates to not overflow the pipeline)

5. Wait until all pipelines are empty

6. Switch buffers
<End frame render>



Rendering pipeline overview

1. Apply transformations to triangle and normal

2. [End here if triangles normal vector Z value is negative]

3. Project triangle position to screen space

4. Convert normal vector Z value into brightness value.

5. Send triangle upper half and lower half into triangle drawing queues




(Each triangle plotter then gets access to it's own pixel plotter)




Triangle plotting overview:

The triangle plotters already have the relevant slopes due to their pipelined inputs
