UART Protocol


Commands

All numbers are in little endian

Request max triangle count - [0x01]
    Gets the max amount of triangles the renderer can support, the board will respond with [0x01, {u16 triangle count}]

Transmit object - [0x02, {u16 triangle count}]
    Opens a transmission of an object file, with the triangle count in the header, the board will respond with 0xFF if the triangle count is zero or too much, or 0x02 if it can receive that triangle count
    Then the computer will transmit said amount of triangles, formatted like the following [{i16 a.x}, {i16 a.y}, {i16 a.z}, {i16 b.x}, {i16 b.y}, {i16 b.z}, {i16 c.x}, {i16 c.y}, {i16 c.z}, {i16 n.x}, {i16 n.y}, {i16 n.z}]
